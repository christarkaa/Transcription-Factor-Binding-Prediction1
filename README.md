# Transcription-Factor-Binding-Prediction
In this project, we tackle the task of predicting whether segments of the human chromosome 22 (Chr22) contain binding sites for the JUND transcription factor (TF). We leverage  multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) models to learn from the data and make accurate predictions.
